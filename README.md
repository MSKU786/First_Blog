## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. As a programmer, should I go to work in the western world (e.g. America, Europe, etc.) or remain in the eastern world (e.g. India, China, etc.)?
2. What is the salary difference in the western world and in the eastern world?
3. How are the programmers satisfying about their job between these two sides of the world?
4. Are there more jobs opportunity in the western world than that in the eastern world?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@manishkharola2018/eastern-or-western-countries-which-one-better-for-a-programmer-career-a4a304b57860).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
